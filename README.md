# i3wm dotfiles

Hello!!! These are the dotfiles of i3 window manager. These config files are the files I used to rice my i3 window manager on my personal computer. 
Note that all files are not written completely by me. Some of them are collected from various sources in internet and a little tweaked to customize them to match my taste.

## Apps I used
- **Rofi** for app launcher.
* **Polybar**
+ **i3blocks** to customize the i3 status bar
* **feh** for setting wallpaper on i3
- picom for  background blur and transparent window
